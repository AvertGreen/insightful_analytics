# Sales Analysis and LTV Dashboard

## Project Description

This project is a Power BI dashboard designed to analyze sales data, calculate customer Lifetime Value (LTV), identify sales trends, and visualize regional sales intensity. The main objectives were:  
- Calculate and analyze customer LTV;  
- Identify sales trends over time;  
- Visualize sales distribution across regions using intensity maps.  

Data was imported from Excel files, and any inconsistencies were handled based on logical assumptions, documented in the final insights.

## Data Description

The dataset includes the following tables:  
- products
- sales
- customers

## Tools and Technologies  
- Power BI Desktop  
- Microsoft Excel (data source)  
- DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) for calculations  

## Main Stages of Work  
1. Data import from Excel files;  
2. Data cleaning and validation (handling missing values, duplicates, and anomalies);  
3. Calculation of LTV using DAX;  
4. Creation of visualizations for sales trends and regional intensity maps;  
5. Summary of key insights and recommendations based on the analysis.  

## Results  
- Developed an interactive Power BI dashboard showcasing LTV, sales trends, and regional sales intensity;  
- Identified key sales patterns and high-value customer segments;  
- Provided recommendations for optimizing sales strategies and targeting high-LTV customers.
